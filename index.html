        <b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> (30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a
        Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
        famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he
        created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most
        of which date from the last two years of his life. They include
        landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are
        characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
        brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not
        commercially successful in his career, he struggled with severe
        depression and poverty, which eventually led to his suicide at age
        thirty-seven.

      <!--second paragraph-->
      Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was
      considered a madman and a failure. As he became famous only after his
      suicide, he came to be seen as a misunderstood genius in the public
      imagination. His reputation grew in the early 20th century as elements of
      his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists.
      He attained widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing
      decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose
      troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist.
      Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to
      have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the
      Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection
      of his paintings and drawings.
